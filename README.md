# GifTastic

In this gif app, users will be able use the provided buttons to get 10 gifs of that particular animal. Users will also be able to add new buttons with different animals of their choice, and when they select a button 10 related gifs will appear. This app utilizes the Giphy API to get and display animal gifs.

To accomplish this, I used:

-Giphy API.
-J-Queries and functions in my javascript file to read through the button requests.
