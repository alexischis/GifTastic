# GifTastic

In this gif app, users will be able use the provided buttons to get gifs of that particular animal. Users will also be able to add new buttons with different animals of their choice.

# Motivation
I created this game as a part of the curriculum of the Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp at UConn, offered by Trilogy.

# Tech Used
This app was built with javascript and APIs.

# How It Works
When the screen loads, the user will see six buttons titled after six different animals at the top of the screen. Users can click a button to load ten gifs related to that animal; these gifs will appear in the body of the web page. The gifs appear due to a call to the Giphy API. If a user is interested in finding gifs of animals of their choice, they can utilize the "Add An Animal!" form to generate a button for that animal. Once the button is created it will be added to the line of buttons on top of the page and will be clickable to populate the page with gifs of that particular animal.
To accomplish this, I used:
-Giphy API.
-J-Queries and functions in my javascript file to read through the button requests.
